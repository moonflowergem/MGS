Swayed by his warm affection, Seori shares his body and heart.\nHowever, in order to capture the tiger demon 'Muryung', the one that plunged the kingdom into chaos, Parang has to make use of Seori, Muryung's adopted son— \n'All I have is this impressive body, so will you still take me?'\n Raws link: https://www.bomtoon.com/detail/2ri_sea ",
