Reborn as a webtoon from the solo animation by the maker of Hyperventilation, Bboung Bbang Kkyu! “In Joong-gu of Seoul City, with flashy buildings set in the background, along a shabby construction zone road… lives a vampire.” Meet Mignon, who, after losing his parents at a young age, works as a car mechanic by day, but an MMA fighter in an illegal fighting ring by night. As he lives, straddled by exploitation and violence day by day, the only person who shows any care and lends a helping hand is Youngwon, a doctor who works at said fighting ring. One day, Mignon discovers Youngwon’s dangerous secret and offers his help by promising he’d do everything Youngwon asks. MIgnon’s genuine and affectionate advances despite knowing Youngwon’s true identity touches him, with Youngwon gradually opening his heart to him, but the hellish reality that has Mignon trapped starts to shake up even Youngwon’s life…
