  "description": "<Demon>. \nA word that often refers to devils, Satan, and all things wicked. Except here, it's just a job popular for it's stability and high income. Woohyeok, a struggling convenience store part-timer, makes a bid for the annual incubus open recruitment and ends up receiving a baffling offer from his friend Siwoon, whom he's been thankful to constantly rely on for a long time… 'You want to pass the incubus exam that bad?
